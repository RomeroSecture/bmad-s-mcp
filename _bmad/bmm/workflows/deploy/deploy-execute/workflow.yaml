# This workflow REQUIRES:
# 1. Prior execution of deploy-configure (DC) — deployment artifacts must exist
# 2. The platform MCP must be available — this workflow EXECUTES actions
# 3. Secrets configured in CI/CD platform

# Human confirmation model:
# - Staging/Development: Single [C] confirmation per action
# - Production: DOUBLE confirmation — [C] then explicit "DEPLOY PRODUCTION" typed
